# testing-isotropy-universe


According to the standard cosmological model, the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales. We want to this by using Type Ia supernovae which serve as standard candles. Since present data (the JLA dataset) is not enough to rule out a large scale anisotropy, we explore how much future data we would need to settle down this question. We explore for what values of the model and data parameters, a simple toy model with an anisotropic expansion can be distinguished from the standard cosmological model.
